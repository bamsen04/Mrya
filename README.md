# Mrya Programming Language

**Mrya** is a lightweight, beginner-friendly programming language designed to introduce core programming concepts in a clean and approachable way.

## Features

- Simple syntax with readable structure
- Variable declarations using `let`
- Output to console using `output()` supports concatenation
- Math equations

## Documentation

Full language syntax and usage instructions are available in the [Wiki](https://github.com/sharkblocks00/Mrya/wiki).

## Roadmap

### A new version of Mrya will roll out when the Roadmap is completed and bug checks are finished. A new Roadmap will then be created.
This roadmap outlines the major features planned for the next version of Mrya.

- **Logical Operators**: Implement `and` and `or` for more expressive conditions.
- **For Loops**: Add a `for (item in list)` loop for easy iteration.
- **Map Literals**: Introduce a literal syntax for maps, like `let my_map = { "key": "value" }`.
- **Runtime Type Annotations**: Add optional type hints (e.g., `let name as int = 10`) that are enforced during execution.
- **String Methods**: Add a standard library of functions for string manipulation (e.g., `to_upper`, `trim`, `replace`).
